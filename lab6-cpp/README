Am folosit libraria ORBit2 pe Ubuntu 9.10.

Am generat fisierele c/h folosind comanda:
orbit-idl-2 --skeleton-impl Calculator.idl

In fisierul server.c am inlocuit functia: 
	etk_raised_exception(ev)
cu expresia: 
	(ev)->_major != CORBA_NO_EXCEPTION

Am rulat serverul orb folosind comanda:
	orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050
	
After calling make in terminal window all sources have been compiled and you 
should open a second terminal window. In the first window we will start the 
server with the command: calculator-server > calculator.ref. The server should 
print a very long string into the file calculator.ref, starting with the 4 
character sequence IOR: In the second window we start the client with the 
command calculator-client `cat calculator.ref` IOR-string. You should not try 
to type the IOR string, instead use the cut and paste functionality of your 
xterm or whatever you are using.
